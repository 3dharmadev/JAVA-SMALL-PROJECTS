The Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

The features of Java stream are –
A stream is not a data structure but it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
Different Operations On Streams-
Intermediate Operations:

map: The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);
List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");
sorted: The sorted method is used to sort the stream.
List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");
List result = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
List square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toList());
filter: The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.

List id = Arrays.asList(“Classes","Methods","Members");
List output = id.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("M")).collect(Collectors.toList());

map: this

List list1= Arrays.asList(1,3,5,7);
List finalList = list1.stream().map(a -> a * a * a).forEach(b -> System.out.println(b));
