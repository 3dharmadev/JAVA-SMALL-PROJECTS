What is the difference between the Class level lock and the Object level lock?
class level lock won't allow any thread to access and execute the synchronized static method.
object level lock can be used when you want non-static method or non-static block of the code should be accessed by only one thread.
class level lock is one per class while object level lock as many as object can be.
