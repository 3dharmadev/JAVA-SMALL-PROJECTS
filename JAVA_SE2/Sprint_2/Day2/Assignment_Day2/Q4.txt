 What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
A synchronized method uses the method receiver as a lock, ‘this’ for non static methods and the enclosing class for static methods.
Synchronized blocks use the expression as a lock.

 For synchronized methods, the lock will be held throughout the method scope.
 In the synchronized block, the lock is held only during that block scope also referred to as critical section.
