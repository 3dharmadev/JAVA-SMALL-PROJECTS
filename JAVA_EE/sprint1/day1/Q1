 Explain the Build process of the Java Application, How the Maven helps in the application build?

Build process contains 8 steps -:
1.Writing source code
2.add dependency files(adding external jar to classpath like mysql connector)
3.compiling code
4.preparing test cases
5.adding test case dependency to classpath
6.compile and run the testcases
7.generate test report
8.arrange code in a standard folder structure

 after completion of above thing deploy war/jar on the server , if we want to add new features
 to the existing webapp then we need to do the above task again and again.
so there is different build tool or project management tool through which
we can do above task after modification on source code.


maven is one of the building tool or project management tool through which

we can develop java application using maven 2 ways:
1.using console based .
Here we need to download maven software and install it in our computer ,
and then we need to set path and some environment variable.
2. using IDE:
here we need to create maven project and adding some required things and done.

 using 8 step maven build the project:
 1.validate check project directory structure
 2.compile source code
 3.compile test cases
 4.then it will run all testcases
 5.package:it will make a jar file of that project
 6.install:save jar in local repo.
 7.deploy:maven stores the app in central repo
 8.clean: it will clean files in target folder
