Q3/- What is the Difference between the Java Bean class and the POJO class.

Java bean class is nothing but we encapsulate our data inside method that means a class should be a public type,
variables should be private type and there may have public getters nd setters and it should not extend or implement any third party library.
where as in POJO the rule is that the class should not implement or extend any third party jar files class/interface and internal methods and variables
can be any kind of structure.

Java bean is a special pojo which have above restrictions.
      POJO                                                                          JAVA BEAN

Fields can be accessed by their names.                                       	Fields are accessed only by getters and setters.
Fields can have any visibility.	                                                Fields have only private visibility.
There may/may-not be a no-arg constructor.                                   	It must have a no-arg constructor.
It is used when you don’t want to give restriction on your                      It is used when you want to provide user your entity but only some part of your entity
