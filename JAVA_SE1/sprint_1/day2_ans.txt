typecasting means when you assign a value of one data type to other type is known as typecasting. It is of two types
implicit and explicit.
Implicit means automatic typecasting or compiler automatically make it possible ,
like when you storing a smaller value  into a larger size data type it is called implicit typecasting .
byte a=10;
int b;
b=a;
in the above example b is the byte type stored easily inside the int type because int can store large number compared to byte .
It is automatic type conversion .
 but in explicit typecasting you storing large number into a smaller size data type so you need to manually type the datatype
 for that type conversion.
 example

 int a=122211231;
 byte b= (byte) a;
here you need to manually type the data type because you are storing a large value inside the smaller data type.

Local variable means if you declare a variable inside of method then it is called local variable and
 if you declare a variable inside of class but outside the body of method is  called instance variable.
