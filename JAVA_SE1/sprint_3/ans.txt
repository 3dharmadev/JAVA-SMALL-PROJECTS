upcasting the way to store child reference inside of parent object stack , other defination is storing a sub type into the super type .
It is also called as implicit type casting means it's automatic storing of smaller thing in large container.

  public class _Upcasting_Better_Example {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Bike bike=new KTM();
      }
  }
  class Bike{
      void run(){
          System.out.println("bike running");
      }
  }

  class KTM extends Bike{
      @Override
      void run() {
          System.out.println("KTM bike running");
      }
  }
  in the above example we are storing a sub class reference or object or KTM heap memory location inside the stack super class object by creating
  super class object of Bike.
