1.Arraylist is dynamic that means it's default storing size is 16 when storing capacity cross 75% it will create a new array
 double size of it's initial size in the other hand linked list store memory address of the data instead of storing  the actual data.
 Array list is slower while linked list is much faster compare to array list. manipulation of data in array list even slower compared to
  linked list. linked list store current address and points to the reference address to next node.
