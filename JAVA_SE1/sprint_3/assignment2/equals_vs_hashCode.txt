equals() method internally compares the object address which used == operator  whereas hashcode method create a numeric address of any object
 created . hashcode gives a numeric value to an internal memory address.

 equals compare two objects while hashcode is used in hashing to decide which group an object should be placed into like if we consider
 two string with same value , it will give same hashcode to both of the strings while comparing we jsut comparing the address of hashcode
 nothing more than this.
