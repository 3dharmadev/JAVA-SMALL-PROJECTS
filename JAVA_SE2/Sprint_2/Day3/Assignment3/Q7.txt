Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).
single resource shared by multiple threads simultaneously, which leads to the Race condition that may cause data inconsistency problem.
by the help of synchronized keyword we can achieve thread safety in java.
if a method  is declared as sync as at a time only one thread is allowed to execute that method or block on the given object.
so the data inconsistency problem will be resolved.
 benefits of sync method is if one thread executing one sync method then another thread can not access to the method to execute ,
 this is call thread safety.

 when two synchronized threads communicates with each other  is called inter thread communication.
 if a one thread wants wants the complete data inside of another sync method and another sync method also get execute by
 another thread we can achieve inter thread communication using wait() and notify() method.
