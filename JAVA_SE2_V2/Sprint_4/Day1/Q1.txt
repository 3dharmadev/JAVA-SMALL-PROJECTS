Q1/- 1. What is the requirement of Java Database communication?
     RDBMS software are excellent in storing data in a secure and easily
     retrieval manner, but it is very poor in processing and presenting the data
     in user understandable format.
     in the same way our java app is excellent in processing and presenting the data but
     very poor in storing the data.
     we can store data in java inside the file using serialization but not better than  RDBMS.
     so in order to build powerful application we  need integreation of RDBMS and java.


Q2/- 2. What is JDBC, Write a note on JDBC driver software.
 JDBC stands for java database connectivity through which java can communicate with the
 RDBMS database.To use jdbc we need to download jdbc software and configure that into
 classpath for that application then we can use those necessary classes inside our project.
 Driver vendor will create JDBC software for that RDBMS app.

Q3/- Write a Jdbc application to establish the connection with the Mysql database.

To use jdbc  software we need to download jdbc software and configure that into
 classpath for that application then we can use those necessary classes inside our project.
 Driver vendor will create JDBC software for that RDBMS app.
 step 1 download jdbc software for mysql
 step 2 config classpath and add downloaded jar for your project
 step 3 load Driver using Class.forName
 step 4 use database url to connect with the database
 step 5 add url username password to DriverManager.getConnection
step 6 use the connection object for your application
Q4/- Write down the responsibilities of the Jdbc Client.
JDBC client is not different than Java developer which will create the connection
with the database , perform some operation with database then close the connection.
