What is the difference between the synchronized block and the synchronized
method? Write down the different syntaxes of the synchronized block with examples.

synchronized method makes everything synchronized for that method that means until the execution finished of that thread ,
 even we want to execute one line of code for synchronized though but we other  thread can not use that object lock ,
 it degrade the performance , but  using synchronized block we can achieve same thread safety using synchronized block ,
 it only allow to write inside of method not inside of constructor , what it will do , it will make thread accessible for one thread at a time.

 other statements can parallelly executed without any block of wait .

 public void run() {

         synchronized (this){  //this one  is the example of synchronized block inside of a method
             for (int i=1;i<=10;i++){
                 multi*=i;
             }
             this.notify();
         }

     }

      public   synchronized void funA(){ //this one is the  example of synchronized method
             System.out.println("welcome....");

             try {
                 Thread.sleep(1000);
             } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                 throw new RuntimeException(e);
             }
             System.out.println("Admin");
         }
