## Problem 1 :

Consider the following bean class:

```java
class Employee{
	empId: int
	name: String
	address: String
	salary: int
}
```

Add 10 Employee objects to the list. And grace the salary by 1000 to those employees whose salary is less than 5000.

**Note:** Using Lambda Expression.

## Problem 2 :

Create a List of cities and sort them in descending order using Lambda Expression.

## Problem 3 :

Create a Product bean class having the following properties:

```java
class Product{
productId: int
productName: String
quantity: int
price: int
}
```

Inside the main method of the Demo class, create a List of 5 products and sort that list by using price (in descending order)

**Note:** for sorting, make use of the Lambda expression.

## **Problem 4 :**

Create a Student bean class having the following properties:

```java
class Student{
roll: int
name: String
email: String
marks: int
}
```

Sort the following Map by its value (by Student name in descending order), using Lambda expressions. 

In this Map key will be the Country name and the value will be the Student

```java
public Map<String, Student> sortMapUsingStudentName(Map<String, Student> originalMap);
```

Add 10 Student objects from different locations and Sort the above Map by its value (by Student name in ascending order).

**Note:** Sort the above Map using Lambda Expression.
