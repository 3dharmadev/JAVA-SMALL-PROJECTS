Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread? with proper example.

Thread class implements runnable interface while runnable interface is a function interface contains run method.

Thread class have overriden run method with empty implementation , if we extend thread class then we need to override
 run method second time then we can declare whatever we want to declare inside the run method then we need to call start
 method using child object of thread class . inside the start method there is a run method called which will call the child class run ethod.
 but in this case you can not achieve multiple inheritance.

 if we implement runnable interface we can achieve multiple inheritance .
 after implementing runnable interface you need  to over ride the run method and write your declaration then you need to
 create the object of thread class inside the main method then you need to pass the implemented class inside the thread object as argument.
 then you can call start method using object of thread class then it will start the same run method using another thread.
