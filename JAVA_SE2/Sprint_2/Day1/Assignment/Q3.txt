Differentiate between process and thread based multitasking.

Here Process means the different application processes running simultaneously inside a operating system.
Thread basically sub-processes of that application running simultaneously or different thread running simultaneously.

In process base multitasking own address of process is required but in thread base all threads are running under the same process
address.

Thread is a light weight process while process base multitasking comparative heavy weight processes.

Process to process communication is expensive but in thread base they are on same sandbox area or same location area so
communication is cheap in thread base multi tasking.
