Explain about the ORM, what are the benefits of the ORM approach over the
JDBC approach.

    ORM
    Little slower than JDBC.
    SQL queries requirement is comparatively quite less however this does not
    mean that you have to do less work using ORM.
    One of the best orm framework is Hibernate which stores your object directly into the database.
      the frontend part is based on the ORM technique .Even it internally implements JDBC.
     JDBC
     It is faster compare to ORM.
     SQL queries are required here.
     We have to write code manually to store object in the database.
     the backend part is still based on JDBCin
