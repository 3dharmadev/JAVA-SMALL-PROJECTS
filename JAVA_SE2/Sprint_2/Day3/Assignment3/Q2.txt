What is the Difference between the wait and sleep methods?

Wait() method release the lock during Synchronization but sleep method does not release lock during Synchronization.
Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context. There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
wait method will wait for the required function completion until the proper value generated. sleep only make that the execution or thread sleep for that particular time only/
