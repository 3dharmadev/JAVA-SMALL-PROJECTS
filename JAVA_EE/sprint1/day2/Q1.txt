Q1/- Limitation of JDBC-based persistence logic over the ORM.

 the process of saving/storing java objects into the database software is known as java persistance.

 for small application we can store business data into the file using IO streams.

  but for realtime application we store the data inside database using jdbc.
  the logic that we write to store java objects into the database using jdbc is known as jdbc based persistence logic.

  jdbc can not store the java objects into the table directly because sql queries not allows the java objects as input, here  we need to
  convert obj data into the atomic value to store them in database.

  jdbc code is the database dependent code cause it use database dependent query.
  so jdbc persistence logic is not 100% portable across different DB.

  lots of boilerplate code
  jdbc code throws lots of checked exceptions,programmer needs to handle.
   getting data from result set and setting data in object.
there is no any caching and transaction management support available in jdbc.
